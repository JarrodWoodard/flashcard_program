# flashcard_program
 A simple cli program for flashcard testing

I wanted to make a program that I would use as my method of learning python. This program will challenge you on various terms and definitions in python. 

If it retains my interest I will add more functionality like progress recording and the ability to switch out the flashcards for various subjects via a data file. Next I believe I will look into writting some kind of prpgram that will take glossaries and convert them into dictiories for easy subject switching. 

Any and all feedback welcome, thank you!
